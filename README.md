# Aranya Core

This repo is a cargo workspace for the Rust implementation for the core of the Aranya platform.

## Cargo Make

This repo uses `cargo-make` as a task runner.

### Install

```
cargo install cargo-make --locked
```

### Usage

`cargo-make` can be used as a cargo plugin via `cargo make <task>` or directly as `makers <task>`.

Note that you must be in the root directory of the repo to run tasks. To view all tasks, run `cargo make` or see [`Makefile.toml`](Makefile.toml).

```sh
# lists all tasks

# auto-format files
makers fmt

makers unit-tests

# run correctness checks
makers correctness
```
